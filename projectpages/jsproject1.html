        <h3 style="text-align: center;">JavaScript CMS Project</h3>
        <p> In this project I was tasked with creating a CMS system for my blog. CMS stands for "Content Management System," and would be used to very easily add new blog posts without having to manually edit the HTML. </p>
        <p> The goal would to have a page dedicated to an easily fillable form that the blog owner could enter text and information into. The CMS would then, utilizing JavaScript, create a new HTML page with the user input, and add the page to my main blog site. </p> 
        <p> The project is still in progress, however for now I have a rough functioning example of how it should work created using WindowsForms.</p>
