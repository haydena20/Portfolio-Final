        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Minecraft AdvMacro Mod</h3>
        <p> This project is still in it's early stages, however I plan to continue working on this mod for Minecraft. It's goal is to allow the player to make, save, and swap between presets of keyboard macros usable in-game. </p>
        <p> The idea comes from many popular servers having many, MANY commands that the player has to type out manually, often quickly. Other Macro mods exist, but many lack features, have issues, or are discontinued. </p>
        <p> Modding Minecraft is a decent undertaking in itself, however the project scope is simple. It will simply need to write to file, load the file at startup, and parse input. The most challenging part will likely be user interface. </p>
