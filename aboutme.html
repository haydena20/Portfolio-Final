            Hello! My name is Hayden Anderson and this is my blog. For the most part, my posts are placeholder, and might be updated later down the line.

            This website, however is fully functional and very easy to add on to through the css. Once we get on with JS and I have more time to work on this, I might add a field to create new posts without manually editing creating new htmls and editing the text in the CSS.
